Functional Morphology for Koine Greek
-------------------------------------

Introduction
------------

This is program attempting to provide morphology for Koine Greek. It
is based on Functional Morphology by Markus Forsberg and Aarne Ranta
[1]. The original FM package implemented Latin morphology, this
package is based on the Latin definitions and some of the old code
still exists in files. These should be removed as functionality for
Greek is becoming more complete.

Building
--------

To build the project, type 'make'. You will need C development
environment (GCC) and Glasgow Haskell Compiler (GHC).
